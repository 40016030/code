Why I make the exact design, what is the reason of it, include that people like it the most
Maybe include:
-	Why I used specifically this colour palette (maybe write about people associations with green technologies, for example green for grass, and blue for sky, white for clouds)
-	Explain The reason of using such font to website and the picture to your logo
-	How you show interactive elements and inputs (maybe to make it user friendly, and you should present calmness as you provide alternative solution instead of aggressive pollution towards our nature, so be like pacifist)
-	About the overall layout, just add that you want to show the message of the company in the first place
Overall explain why you have made these design choices. (You have to include at least something to get marks)
