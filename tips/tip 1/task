You work for a software development company. The company has secured a contract 
to develop a solution for a local green technology company, Rolsa Technologies. Rolsa 
Technologies specialises in:
• solar panel installation and maintenance
• electric vehicle (EV) charging stations
• smart home energy management systems.
The clients (owners of Rolsa Technologies) would like to develop a digital solution 
that will:
• provide customers with information about:
– green energy products currently on the market
– how to reduce their carbon footprint
• allow customers to:
– schedule consultations and installations
– calculate their carbon footprint.
The client has conducted market research with existing customers to identify features 
that could be included in the digital solution. The suggested features by the client are:
• account registration to allow customers to manage their consultations and data
• accessibility features to support a wide range of users
• a tool for calculating and tracking energy usage.


Activity A(i)
You have been asked to carry out research to prepare for developing a proposal for the 
digital solution. Your research should consider how digital solutions are used to meet 
the needs of different users within the energy sector, including:
• how hardware and software are used within the context of the industry
• newly emerging technologies
• how digital solutions could be used to meet different user needs
• the industry-specific guidelines and regulations you will need to follow.
Any notes you produce should be kept and submitted as an appendix.
Activity A(ii)
Produce a detailed proposal for a digital solution that you would develop to meet the 
needs of:
• the client (Rolsa Technologies) 
• existing and potential users.
Your proposal should provide a rationale for the solution you are proposing and include:
• the business context
• the functional and non-functional requirements of the solution
• decomposition of the problems that will need to be solved to implement the 
functional and non-functional requirements
• the key performance indicators (KPIs) and user acceptance criteria for the 
proposed solution
• a description of the proposed solution
• justification of:
– how the recommended solution meets the needs of the client and users
– how potential risks will be mitigated
– how relevant regulatory guidelines and legal requirements, in relation to 
software development and the energy sector, will be addressed.

Activity B
Produce a set of design documents for the digital solution you are proposing. The 
design documentation must include:
• visual/interface designs
• data requirements
• a selection of algorithm designs
• a test strategy.
Your proposed solution must be of sufficient scope and complexity to demonstrate your 
ability to implement code in at least two appropriate languages to implement front-end 
and back-end processes.
Your design documents should provide sufficient detail to:
• effectively communicate the intended solution to both technical and 
non-technical stakeholders
• allow the client to make informed decisions
• allow a third-party developer to use the design documents to create the 
proposed solution.
Your test strategy does not need to detail specific tests for every part of the solution. 
However, it should provide a selection of tests, relevant to your proposed solution, 
that show:
• the order in which you intend to test all components of the solution
• the types of test to be carried out for each component.
Your algorithm designs do not need to show the whole solution but should show how 
you would solve a number of different key problems. You should limit your algorithm 
designs to a maximum of five complex problems.

Outcomes for submission
You must submit:
1. A proposal for the designed solution, including appendices of relevant research 
notes to support your rationale.
Save your proposal as a PDF file in your folder for submission. Use this 
naming convention:
– Task1_Proposal_[Registration number]_[Surname]_[First letter of first name]
2. A set of design documents.
Save your completed design documents as PDF files in your folder for submission. 
Use this naming convention:
– Task1_DesignDocs_[Document name]_[Registration number]_[Surname]_
[First letter of first name
