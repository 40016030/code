Logo
I created the Rolsa Technologies logo using Canva. I chose an icon of a solar panel with the sun above it to directly represent a purpose of the company. I selected a user-friendly font for the company name placed beneath the icon, to make sure that it is clear, easy to read, and professional, which enhances the overall design.
 
Colours
When I was choosing colours for the Rolsa Technologies website, I focused on how these colours would represent the company’s message, ensuring that users could clearly understand they were on a green energy company's website. I decided to use the colours grey, white, black, and dark green. Dark green symbolizes nature, connecting the website to the environment and emphasizing the company’s core purpose. White represents clarity and professionalism. Black provides contrast, making the website visually appealing. Grey creates balance by softening the sharp contrast between white and black, while also representing the calm and stability of the company.
Dark green: #266429
Black: #000000
White: #FFFFFF
Grey: #E8E8E8


I used WebAIM website to check the contrast of the colours I was using.

 
All the attached designs for Rolsa Technologies digital solution were created using Figma. The designs may undergo minor changes during future development.
Pseudocode for calculators:
	Carbon footprint calculator:
BEGIN
    DISPLAY "Select Heating Type: Gas, Electric, Solar"
    heating_type ← USER_INPUT

    DISPLAY "Adjust Energy Consumption (0 - 1000 kWh/cubic meters)"
    energy_consumption ← USER_INPUT

    // Retrieve emission factor based on selected heating type
    IF heating_type = "Gas" THEN
        emission_factor ← GAS_EMISSION_FACTOR
    ELSE IF heating_type = "Electric" THEN
        emission_factor ← ELECTRIC_EMISSION_FACTOR
    ELSE
        emission_factor ← SOLAR_EMISSION_FACTOR

    // Calculate carbon footprint
    total_emission ← energy_consumption * emission_factor

    DISPLAY "Your estimated carbon footprint is: " + total_emission + " kg CO2"

    // Provide a consistent recommendation
    DISPLAY "Consider switching to renewable energy sources and reduce energy consumption with energy-efficient appliances."

END
	Energy Consumption Calculator:
BEGIN
    DISPLAY "Select Appliance Type (e.g., Refrigerator, Light Bulb, Microwave)"
    appliance_type ← USER_INPUT

    DISPLAY "Enter Usage Time Per Day (hours)"
    usage_time ← USER_INPUT

    DISPLAY "Enter Number of Appliances"
    num_appliances ← USER_INPUT

    // Retrieve typical wattage for selected appliance
    wattage ← GET_WATTAGE(appliance_type)

    // Calculate total energy consumption
    total_consumption ← wattage * usage_time * num_appliances

    DISPLAY "Your total daily energy consumption is: " + total_consumption + " kWh"

    // Provide a consistent energy-saving recommendation
    DISPLAY "Consider switching to energy-efficient appliances and reducing usage where possible."
