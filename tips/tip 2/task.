Developing the prototype
Develop a functional prototype of your proposed digital solution to meet the 
client’s needs.
During development, make sure you:
• implement secure code in at least two appropriate languages to implement frontend and back-end processes
• gather and prepare appropriate assets to be used in the development of your 
digital solution
• make use of, and document, iterative testing
• document the iterative development process, including changes made to the 
solution during development
• produce code that can be maintained by a third party
• ensure a high-quality user experience
• follow legal and regulatory guidelines and standards.
When gathering assets, you need to record the sources you use in an assets log. 
Your log must:
• record all the sources you have used
• describe the content and its intended purpose
• log the date on which you retrieved the information.
Your testing documentation does not need to include details of every test carried out. 
However, it should demonstrate:
• an iterative approach to testing
• understanding of how to test inputs, calculations, validation and processes using 
appropriate test data.
